# Read-More-Plugin
Wordpress plugin that adds a Read More block and CLI command for searching block usage. Built using @wordpress/create-block  

## Usage

The block can be added in the editor by searching for `DMG Read More`. Once the block has been added you can pick a post from the list of options, or search for a specific post by either the post title or post id.

`npm run build` to generate build files.  
`npm run test` to run unit tests. Test should be added in the `/tests` directory.
